Write a Java project that reads the attached file (data.txt) and parses it into a text file. The text file should be equal to the below json data structure:
{
  'host': 'test.com',
  'server_id': 55331,
  'cost': 2.56,
  'user': 'user',
  'verbose': true,
  'test_mode': true,
  'debug_mode': false,
  'log_file_path': '/tmp/logfile.log',
  'send_notifications': true
}
Your email response should include the following:
1. Instructions on how to setup and run project. Be as detailed as possible. Assume the interviewer doesn't have Java setup on his/her development environment.
2. The java project that includes necessary classes and tests.

We will be looking for readability, extensibility and maintainability.
