Write a Ruby library that reads the attached file (data.txt) and parses it into a Ruby Hash. The hash should be equal to the below data structure:
{
  'host' => 'test.com',
  'server_id' => 55331,
  'cost' => 2.56,
  'user' => 'user',
  'verbose' => true,
  'test_mode' => true,
  'debug_mode' => false,
  'log_file_path' => '/tmp/logfile.log',
  'send_notifications' => true
}
Your email response should attach these two files:
config_parser_spec.rb - rspec file
config_parser.rb - ruby library
We will be looking for readability, extensibility and maintainability.
